# HACK

Hack is a roguelike, originally written by Jay Fenlason with help
from Kenny Woodland, Mike Thome and Jon Payne. Basically it was an
implementation of Rogue, however, with 52+ instead of 26 monster
types. This version is taken from the bsd-games package v2.17.

```sh
./configure --prefix=/usr --with-native
make
make install
hack
```
