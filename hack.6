.Nm hack
.Nd exploring The Dungeons of Doom
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl s
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a display oriented dungeons \*[Am] dragons-like game.
Both display and command structure resemble rogue.
(For a game with the same structure but entirely different display -
a real cave instead of dull rectangles - try Quest.)
.Pp
To get started you really only need to know two commands.
The command
.Ic \&?
will give you a list of the available commands and the command
.Ic /
will identify the things you see on the screen.
.Pp
To win the game (as opposed to merely playing to beat other people's high
scores) you must locate the Amulet of Yendor which is somewhere below
the 20th level of the dungeon and get it out. Nobody has achieved this
yet and if somebody does, he will probably go down in history as a hero
among heroes.
.Pp
When the game ends, either by your death, when you quit, or if you escape
from the caves,
.Nm
will give you (a fragment of) the list of top scorers. The scoring is
based on many aspects of your behavior but a rough estimate is obtained
by taking the amount of gold you've found in the cave plus four times
your (real) experience. Precious stones may be worth a lot of gold when
brought to the exit. There is a 10% penalty for getting yourself killed.
.Pp
The
.Fl s
option will print out the list of top scores.
